# Assignment 4
Design Implementation:
The website design is based on my Monday Figma prototype of a cat café. It includes a navigation bar, hero section, menu section, cats/atmosphere section, newsletter sign-up section, and footer. The hero section features an image of the café with a "Visit" button below the text. The menu section highlights a few popular items (like latte, cappuccino, and croissant). The cats section introduces three of the café’s cats. The newsletter section includes a form where users can sign up, and the footer provides basic location and contact information.

JavaScript Interactions:
I implemented these three interactive features:
1. A hamburger menu that toggles the mobile navigation panel, available when on smaller screens.
2. A modal popup that appears when users click the "Book a Visit" button in the hero section.
3. The newsletter section has a sign-up form with basic validations
   
Challenges Faced:
A challenge I had was making the hero image responsive so it scales properly without breaking that layout and ensuring that all content sections align correctly within the page container. Some of the things were cut off or off-center, so I tried my best to fix them.
